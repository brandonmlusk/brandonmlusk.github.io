## about 

I just finished up my summer internship at Northwestern Mutual where I worked in the actuarial department developing a CRUD web app to track actuarial assumptions. I plan on receiving my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering as well as a second major in Computer Sciences from UW-Madison in December 2022. I enjoy learning about the development process and am especially interested in software engineering. Furthermore, I enjoy the problem solving process and like applying the knowledge I have learned in the class room to real world applications (see my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/brandonmlusk) for examples of this). Finally, I have been fortunate enough to receive the [Chick Evans Caddie Scholarship](https://www.wgaesf.org/a-life-changing-opportunity/) and participate in philanthropic events that they have throughout the school year.

**Previously, I...** 
* was a software developer intern at [West Bend Mutual Insurance](https://www.thesilverlining.com/) where I helped to develop a rating integration API that retrieved insurance quotes 98% faster than the previous implementation.  
* was an applications development co-op student at [Madison Gas & Electric](https://mge.com) working on writing internal applications to help engineers better supply energy to the greater Madison area. For example, I wrote a web application that visualized electrical loads on transformers and allowed the field engineers to make adjustments to ensure no transformer was overstressed. I worked full time throughout the summer and fall of 2020.
* was an assistant manager and lifeguard at the [Cedarburg Community Pool](https://www.ci.cedarburg.wi.us/parks-recreation-and-forestry/pages/pool).
* was a honor caddie at [Ozaukee Country Club](https://www.ozaukeecc.com/).


## informal ##
* I enjoy playing soccer and basketball or pretty much that gets your heart pumping (besides rollercoasters).
* Lifeguarding was my favorite highschool summer job.
* I have a certificate in German and enjoy speaking it in my free time as well as watching the [Bundesliga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga) on the weekends. 
* I enjoy reading and am currently reading [Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid ](https://www.amazon.com/G%C3%B6del-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567).
* During my breaks from school, I have gotten into backpacking and hiking! My favorite national park would have to be [Big Bend National Park](https://www.nps.gov/bibe/index.htm).
* On the weekends, I usually end up working on my car. I am either cleaning it, repairing it, or driving it!
