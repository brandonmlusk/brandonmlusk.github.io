I can be reached through several platforms:

<div>
<a href="mailto:me@brandonmlusk.com">
<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;"
src="../../assets/img/email.png" 
width="100" />
</a>
I can be reached best at <code>me [at] brandonmlusk [dot] com </code>. 
You'll find that I'm quite fast at responding to emails! Contacting me through
email is probably your best way to reach me. If you think it's strange that
I didn't use the "@" and "." while giving out my email, then you might want to

I check LinkedIn messages frequently. If you're trying to connect with me on 
LinkedIn, please add a note especially if we do not know each other personally.
